The run_analysis.R script reads data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0" and produces a 
new - tidy - dataset which may be used for further analysis.

The data in the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0" have been taken from experiments carried out with a group of 
30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed 
six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz data were captured. 
The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, 
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
